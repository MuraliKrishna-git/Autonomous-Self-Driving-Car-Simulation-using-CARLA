# Autonomous-Self-Driving-Car-Simulation-using-CARLA
A Repository containing details and resources to create a model that is capable to drive a car in a lane autonomously.


Hello guys!

This is a simple AIML Project named Autonomous Self-Driving Car Simulation using CARLA

- CARLA is a open-source software that can be used to develop games and test the code for autonomous vehicles.

- So here there should be 3 folders inside the main folder.

- two of them should be empty.

- while creating the model, those two folders will be useful.

- one folder will store the models that are trained for each iterations should be named "models"

- another folder will store the logs for each iteration simultaneously should be named "logs"

- the time to create the model will be approximately 60 hours ( According to my specs of the laptop ) for the complete and accurate model.

My lap Specs are : Lenovo Legion 5 Pro

        - NVIDIA RTX GeForce 3060 8 GB
        - 16 GB RAM, 1 TB ROM, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with Radeon Graphics

- the higest temperature recieved by the laptop during the model creation is 87 degrees.

- first run the steer_cnn.py file by changing the necessary mentioned in the code.

- then run train_cnn.py to create the model.

- then run steer_test.py by changing the necessary in the code and then run test_cnn.py to test the model.

  Enjoy!!!
